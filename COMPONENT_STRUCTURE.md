4. **Testing**: Each component can be tested independently
5. **Performance**: Components can be optimized individually
6. **Team Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components

### 🔧 How to Use

The application is now ready to run with:
```bash
npm start
```

### 📝 Next Steps

This structure makes it easy to:
- Add new pages (JobDetails, UserProfile, CompanyProfile, etc.)
- Implement React Router for navigation
- Add state management (Redux, Zustand, or Context API)
- Create new reusable components
- Add authentication and user management
- Implement job search and filtering logic
- Connect to a backend API

### 🎯 Component Import Pattern

You can now import components cleanly:

```javascript
// Clean barrel imports
import { Header, Footer, JobList } from '../components';

// Or individual imports
import Header from '../components/Header';
```

**Your JobForge application is now professionally structured and ready for development! 🚀**
